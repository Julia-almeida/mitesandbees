## Background

An agent-based model of the Colony Collapse Disorder in honey bees that shows the decline in bees due to pesticides, mites, and pollution. The model starts with very few infected bees and as the mites reproduce the bees start disappearing. The number of infected bees changes seasonally and doubles in July. The mites attach to the bees and the bees turn blue to indicate they are infected.
